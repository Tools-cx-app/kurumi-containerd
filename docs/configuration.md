# Configuration

KurumiContainerd uses strict TOML. Unknown fields and invalid values are rejected.
Start from [kurumi-containerd.example.toml](../kurumi-containerd.example.toml).

Host paths may be absolute or relative to the TOML file. Container paths such
as `init`, mount targets, and device paths are always paths inside the
container.

## Runtime

```toml
[runtime]
stop_timeout_seconds = 15
```

Runtime-owned files are stored in `/run/kurumi-containerd` on Linux and
`$TMP/kurumi-containerd` on Android. The directory must be root-owned, must not
be group/world writable, and must not be a symlink.

## Container

```toml
[container]
name = "debian-dev"
rootfs = "./rootfs"
hostname = "debian-dev"
init = "/sbin/init"
foreground = false
volatile = false
network = "host"
```

Configure exactly one of `rootfs` or `rootfs_image`. A missing `uuid` is
generated on first use and atomically written back to the TOML file.
`volatile = true` places writable OverlayFS layers on tmpfs.

The `install` command creates a missing `rootfs` directory from a local
archive. When `rootfs_image` is configured, `install --size SIZE` creates a
sparse ext4 image at that path. Existing targets require `--force`.

Names may contain ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, and `-`. The values
`.` and `..` are rejected.

## Networking

Network modes are `host`, `none`, `nat`, `gateway`, and `dhcp`.

```toml
[container.network_options]
address = "172.28.0.2"
gateway = "172.28.0.1"
prefix = 16
bridge = "kurumi-br0"
gateway_bridge = ""
dns = ["1.1.1.1", "8.8.8.8"]

[[container.network_options.ports]]
host = 8080
container = 80
protocol = "tcp"
```

NAT and bridge setup currently use fixed host `ip` and `iptables`
executables. `gateway` attaches the container veth to the existing interface
named by `gateway_bridge`. It does not create or manage that bridge.
`dhcp` uses the same existing bridge and runs the first DHCP client found in
the container rootfs: `udhcpc`, `dhclient`, or `dhcpcd`.

```toml
network = "dhcp"

[container.network_options]
gateway_bridge = "br0"
```

## Resources and security

```toml
[container.resources]
memory_bytes = 536870912
cpu_quota = 100000
cpu_period = 100000
pids = 512

[container.security]
read_only_sys = true
allow_user_namespaces = false
```

Resource limits use cgroup v2 when available and otherwise fall back to cgroup
v1. Memory must be at least 4 MiB. CPU quota and period must be configured
together; quota must be at least 1000. The PID limit must be between 1 and
4194304.

Set `allow_user_namespaces = true` for workloads that create unprivileged
user namespaces, such as Docker with userns-remap, Podman, Flatpak, or
Bubblewrap. In this mode the runtime keeps the normal `/proc` and `/sys`
hardening, and also exposes fresh filesystem instances at
`/run/kurumi-containerd/proc` and `/run/kurumi-containerd/sys` so nested
runtime mounts can pass the kernel visibility checks. The proc instance is
writable and the sysfs instance is read-only, so enabling this option weakens
container isolation. Enable it only for trusted workloads.

## Environment and mounts

```toml
[container]
environment_file = "./container.env"

[container.environment]
LANG = "C.UTF-8"

[[container.mounts]]
source = "./shared"
target = "/mnt/shared"
read_only = false
```

Environment files accept `KEY=VALUE`, optional `export`, comments, quoted
values, empty values, and values containing `=`. Inline values win over file
values. Mount sources must exist, and targets must be absolute, non-root paths
without parent traversal.

## Android host integration

The optional `[container.android]` table controls selected storage, GPU,
Binder, Termux:X11, VirGL, PulseAudio, and SELinux integration when KurumiContainerd is
built for Android. These options fail closed on unsupported hosts. They are
runtime features and do not require or provide an Android application.
