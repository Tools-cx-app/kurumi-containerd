# KurumiContainerd

KurumiContainerd is a privileged Linux container runtime and command-line tool written
in Rust. It manages lightweight system containers with Linux namespaces,
mounts, cgroups, networking, and a persistent TOML configuration.

The name comes from **Kurumi**, the Japanese romanization of 胡桃
(“walnut”), combined with **containerd** to reflect the project's purpose.

This repository contains the CLI and runtime only. It does not contain an
Android application. The runtime can still expose optional Android host
resources when compiled for and executed on Android.

> KurumiContainerd is a container runtime, not a security sandbox. Run only root
> filesystems and commands you trust.

## Features

- Directory, ext4 image, btrfs image, and block-device root filesystems
- Local tar/ZIP rootfs installation into directories or sparse ext4 images
- Mount, PID, UTS, IPC, and optional network namespaces
- Host, isolated, NAT, and existing-bridge networking
- cgroup v1 and v2 memory, CPU, and process limits
- Bind mounts and volatile OverlayFS
- Background monitoring and foreground PTY consoles
- Container entry and command execution without an external `nsenter`
- Persistent, PID-reuse-resistant runtime state
- Seccomp filtering and read-only kernel views
- Optional user-namespace support for nested Docker, Podman, Flatpak, and Bubblewrap workloads
- Optional Android host integration without an Android app

## Requirements

- A Linux or Android kernel with the required namespace and mount features
- Root privileges
- Rust 1.85 or newer for the 2024 edition
- `ip` and `iptables` for NAT or bridge networking
- cgroup v1 or v2 when resource limits are configured
- A prepared Linux root filesystem containing an init executable

Run the host capability checks before starting a container:

```bash
sudo cargo run --release -p kurumi-containerd -- check
```

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The binary is written to `target/release/kurumi-containerd`.

## Releases

Push a version tag matching `[workspace.package].version` in `Cargo.toml`
(for example, `git tag v0.2.1 && git push origin v0.2.1`) to automatically
build and publish a GitHub Release. Tags with a prerelease suffix are marked
as prereleases. Publication waits for all ten build targets to succeed.

- GNU Linux (x86_64, aarch64, armv7, riscv64): `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.tar.xz`.
- musl Linux (x86_64, aarch64) and Android (all four CI ABIs): `.tar.xz`.
- `SHA256SUMS` contains checksums for all release packages.

Archives contain the executable, license, READMEs and example configuration.
Debian/RPM packages install the executable into `/usr/bin` and documentation
and the example configuration into `/usr/share/doc/kurumi-containerd`.
GNU packages require the libc version used by the build toolchain or newer;
use the musl archives when a portable Linux binary is needed.

## Quick Start

Create a configuration from the example and update the rootfs path:

```bash
cp kurumi-containerd.example.toml kurumi-containerd.toml
$EDITOR kurumi-containerd.toml
sudo ./target/release/kurumi-containerd --config kurumi-containerd.toml install ./rootfs.tar.zst
sudo ./target/release/kurumi-containerd --config kurumi-containerd.toml start
sudo ./target/release/kurumi-containerd --config kurumi-containerd.toml info
sudo ./target/release/kurumi-containerd --config kurumi-containerd.toml enter
sudo ./target/release/kurumi-containerd --config kurumi-containerd.toml stop
```

`--config` defaults to `kurumi-containerd.toml` and can also be set with
`KURUMI_CONTAINERD_CONFIG`. Relative host paths are resolved from the configuration
file, not from the current working directory.

## Commands

```text
install ARCHIVE [--size SIZE] [--force]
                        Install a local rootfs archive
start [--foreground]   Start the configured container
stop                   Gracefully stop it
restart [--foreground] Stop and start it
enter [USER]           Open an interactive login, defaulting to root
run COMMAND...          Run a non-interactive command
info                    Show live state and resource usage
pid                     Print the container init PID
show                    List containers in the configured work directory
scan                    Recover missing state for validated live containers
check                   Probe required host capabilities
```
